# Segmentation Of Pathologies

In this project, we addressed to the segmentation of brain tumor (BRATS2017) and detection of diabetic retinopathy. The proposed model for brain tumor segmentation are based on the combination of deep Residual Networks a particular architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and correction of intensity non-uniformity "N4BiasFieldCorrection". 

For Diabetic Retinopathy detection we introduce a deep learning based Convolutional Neural Networks method with Transfer Learning, we use two different models Inception V3 and VGGNet16 where only the last layer is retrained.
